In this README.md file:

- We've removed sensitive information from the code example and added comments to indicate where users should replace them with their actual credentials.
- We've kept the focus on explaining how to use your package without including sensitive data.

When sharing your npm package, make sure that your npm package itself does not include any sensitive information in its source code or configuration files. Instead, users should provide their own credentials or configuration when using your package.
